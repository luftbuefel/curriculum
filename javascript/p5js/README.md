# p5.js Games



These are some projects for advanced students who know JavaScript and want to learn how to make web games. They use the [p5.js library for JavaScript](https://p5js.org/), and some of the more advanced ones use an additional library called [p5.play](http://p5play.molleindustria.org/).

Some examples of these games in action are available [here](https://adelapo.github.io/p5/).
