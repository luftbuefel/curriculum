# Example Tkinter Game



## Motivation



[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) is the de facto graphical game library for Python. However, it has a tough learning curve that has even turned some of us Code Coaches (myself included) to other platforms, like JavaScript. This project seeks to determine whether making a graphical game in Python without Pygame is possible. As of now it is still a **work in progress**. Still, feel free to check it out!



## How does it work?



Tkinter is a GUI library for Python, and it comes standard with Python (unlike Pygame). I learned Tkinter from [this online reference, which I *highly* recommend going through](http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/). (Note that the tutorial is from 2005 and assumes Python 2!) One feature that comes with Tkinter is the [Canvas](http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/canvas.htm), a powerful widget that allows for drawing shapes and rendering images.



## Gameplay



The game I'm trying to make is based on the popular mobile game Doodle Jump. My version is called **JumpyGuy!**, since it features Mario as the jumping character.

The real game involves physically tilting the device to move the character, but JumpyGuy instead uses arrow keys for the controls. Also, the graphics are a lot more basic, using rectangles for the platforms and Mario keeping the same height the entire time.



## Teaching This Game to Students



### Pre-reqs



I've used a few advanced Python concepts for this game. If you're going to teach this particular game to your students, the students will need to have a strong grasp of object-oriented programming in Python, including inheritance.



### Lessons

Teaching this game can give your students the opportunity to learn the following concepts:


* Vectors

* Kinematics, the relationships among position, velocity, and acceleration

* Gravity

* Game logic

* The Tkinter Canvas

* Reading, writing text files from Python
